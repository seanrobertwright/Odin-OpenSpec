# Theme Management Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Light and Dark Theme Support
The theme system must provide comprehensive light and dark color schemes that affect all application UI elements.

#### Scenario: Theme Selection and Application
**Given** the application is running with the default theme  
**When** the user selects a different theme from the header controls  
**Then** all UI elements should immediately update to use the new theme colors  
**And** the theme change should apply to all currently loaded modules  
**And** background colors, text colors, and accent colors should all update consistently

#### Scenario: System Theme Integration
**Given** the user has not manually selected a theme  
**When** the application starts  
**Then** the theme should match the current Windows system theme (light/dark)  
**When** the Windows system theme changes while the app is running  
**Then** the application theme should automatically update to match  
**Unless** the user has explicitly overridden the theme setting

#### Scenario: Theme Persistence
**Given** the user has selected a specific theme  
**When** the application is closed and reopened  
**Then** the previously selected theme should be restored  
**And** the theme preference should be saved per user profile  
**When** switching between user profiles  
**Then** each profile should maintain its own theme preference

### Requirement: Touch-Optimized Visual Elements  
The theme system must provide visual styles optimized for touch interaction while maintaining visual hierarchy and readability.

#### Scenario: Touch Target Sizing
**Given** any UI element in any theme  
**When** the element is interactive (button, toggle, input, etc.)  
**Then** the element should meet minimum touch target size of 44x44 logical pixels  
**And** adequate spacing should exist between adjacent interactive elements  
**And** visual feedback should be provided for touch interactions

#### Scenario: Visual Contrast and Readability
**Given** any theme is active  
**When** text content is displayed  
**Then** text should meet WCAG AA contrast ratio requirements  
**And** focus indicators should be clearly visible for keyboard navigation  
**And** disabled states should be distinguishable but still readable  
**And** selection highlights should provide clear visual feedback

#### Scenario: Touch State Visual Feedback
**Given** interactive elements in any theme  
**When** the user touches an element  
**Then** immediate visual feedback should be provided (pressed state)  
**And** the pressed state should be distinct from hover and normal states  
**When** the touch is released  
**Then** the element should return to normal state or show activated state  
**And** touch ripple effects should be used where appropriate

### Requirement: Dynamic Theme Resource Management
The theme system must efficiently manage and update visual resources across the entire application.

#### Scenario: Resource Dictionary Management  
**Given** the application has multiple theme resource dictionaries  
**When** a theme change is requested  
**Then** the appropriate resource dictionary should be loaded  
**And** previous theme resources should be properly unloaded  
**And** all bound UI elements should automatically update  
**And** custom control templates should reflect the new theme

#### Scenario: Theme Resource Extensibility
**Given** modules need to define custom theme-aware styling  
**When** modules register their theme resources  
**Then** module resources should integrate with the global theme system  
**And** module-specific colors should respond to theme changes  
**And** conflicts between module and global resources should be resolved consistently  
**When** switching themes  
**Then** all module resources should update along with global resources

#### Scenario: Performance During Theme Changes
**Given** the application has multiple views and complex UI elements loaded  
**When** the user switches themes  
**Then** the theme change should complete within 300ms  
**And** UI should remain responsive during the transition  
**And** no visual glitches or flashing should occur  
**And** memory usage should not increase significantly with theme switching
