# Application Shell Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Fullscreen Landscape Layout
The application shell must provide a fullscreen, landscape-oriented layout optimized for touch interaction while maintaining mouse and keyboard accessibility.

#### Scenario: Application Startup
**Given** the application is launched  
**When** the main window initializes  
**Then** the window should open in fullscreen mode  
**And** the layout should be optimized for landscape orientation  
**And** all UI elements should meet minimum touch target sizes (44x44 logical pixels)

#### Scenario: Input Method Detection  
**Given** the application is running  
**When** the user interacts via touch input  
**Then** the UI should adapt to touch-optimized spacing and visual states  
**When** the user interacts via mouse and keyboard  
**Then** the UI should provide appropriate hover states and keyboard navigation

#### Scenario: On-Screen Keyboard Integration
**Given** a text input field is focused via touch  
**When** the user taps the input field  
**Then** the Windows on-screen keyboard should appear automatically  
**And** the application layout should adjust to accommodate the keyboard  
**When** the input field loses focus  
**Then** the on-screen keyboard should dismiss and layout should restore

### Requirement: Application Shell Structure
The shell must provide a structured layout with distinct areas for header, navigation, and content display.

#### Scenario: Shell Layout Rendering
**Given** the application shell is initialized  
**When** the main view renders  
**Then** a header area should be displayed at the top containing user info and controls  
**And** a collapsible navigation sidebar should be displayed on the left  
**And** a main content area should occupy the remaining space  
**And** all areas should be clearly visually separated

#### Scenario: Content Area Management
**Given** the shell is displaying module content  
**When** a new module is selected  
**Then** the content area should transition to show the new module  
**And** the previous module content should be properly cleaned up  
**And** the header should update to reflect the current module context

#### Scenario: Modal Dialog Support
**Given** a module needs to display a modal dialog  
**When** the dialog is requested  
**Then** an overlay should appear over the entire shell content  
**And** the underlying content should be dimmed and non-interactive  
**And** the modal should be centered and touch-accessible  
**When** the modal is dismissed  
**Then** the overlay should be removed and underlying content restored

### Requirement: Responsive Layout Adaptation
The shell layout must adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining usability across supported resolutions.

#### Scenario: Variable Screen Resolution Support
**Given** the application is running on different screen resolutions  
**When** the window is displayed  
**Then** content should scale appropriately for the screen size  
**And** touch targets should remain at least 44x44 logical pixels  
**And** text should remain readable at all supported resolutions  
**And** layout proportions should be maintained across different aspect ratios

#### Scenario: Dynamic Content Scaling
**Given** the user has vision accessibility needs  
**When** the system text scaling is increased  
**Then** all shell UI elements should scale proportionally  
**And** touch targets should grow to maintain minimum size requirements  
**And** layout should adapt to prevent content overflow or clipping
