# User Management Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: User Profile Creation and Management
The system must allow creation, editing, and management of multiple user profiles with distinct settings and preferences.

#### Scenario: New User Profile Creation
**Given** the application is running  
**When** the user initiates creating a new profile  
**Then** a profile creation dialog should appear  
**And** the user should be able to enter a display name  
**And** the user should be able to select or capture a profile photo  
**And** the new profile should be saved to local storage  
**When** the profile creation is completed  
**Then** the new profile should become the active profile

#### Scenario: Profile Photo Management
**Given** a user is creating or editing their profile  
**When** selecting a profile photo  
**Then** the user should be able to choose from existing images  
**And** the user should be able to capture a new photo using device camera (if available)  
**And** photos should be automatically cropped to square aspect ratio  
**And** photos should be resized appropriately for display in header  
**When** no photo is selected  
**Then** a default avatar icon should be used with the user's initials

#### Scenario: Profile Settings and Preferences
**Given** an active user profile  
**When** the user modifies settings (theme, language, etc.)  
**Then** settings should be saved to the current profile  
**And** settings should persist across application sessions  
**And** different profiles should maintain independent settings  
**When** switching between profiles  
**Then** each profile's settings should be applied automatically

### Requirement: Profile Switching and Authentication  
The system must provide easy switching between user profiles while maintaining security and data separation.

#### Scenario: Profile Selection Interface
**Given** multiple user profiles exist  
**When** the user taps the profile area in the header  
**Then** a profile switcher should appear  
**And** all available profiles should be listed with photos and names  
**And** the current profile should be visually indicated  
**When** the user selects a different profile  
**Then** the application should switch to the selected profile  
**And** all user-specific data and settings should load for the new profile

#### Scenario: Profile Data Isolation  
**Given** multiple user profiles with different data  
**When** switching between profiles  
**Then** calendar data should be completely separate between profiles  
**And** task lists should be profile-specific  
**And** application state (navigation, module settings) should be per-profile  
**And** no data should leak between different user profiles  
**When** one profile is deleted  
**Then** other profiles should remain unaffected

#### Scenario: Profile Lock and Security
**Given** user profiles contain personal information  
**When** the application is inactive for extended periods  
**Then** a profile lock screen should optionally appear  
**And** users should be able to configure auto-lock timeout  
**When** returning to a locked profile  
**Then** authentication should be required before accessing profile data  
**And** Windows Hello authentication should be supported if available

### Requirement: Profile Data Persistence and Migration
The system must reliably store and migrate user profile data across application updates and device changes.

#### Scenario: Profile Data Storage
**Given** user profile information and settings  
**When** data is modified  
**Then** changes should be immediately persisted to local SQLite database  
**And** profile photos should be stored in application local data folder  
**And** data corruption should be prevented through transactional updates  
**When** the application starts  
**Then** the most recently active profile should be restored automatically

#### Scenario: Profile Import and Export
**Given** users may want to backup or transfer profiles  
**When** exporting a profile  
**Then** all profile data should be packaged into a secure export file  
**And** sensitive data should be encrypted in the export  
**When** importing a profile  
**Then** the profile should be validated before import  
**And** conflicts with existing profiles should be handled gracefully  
**And** imported profiles should maintain data integrity

#### Scenario: Profile Data Migration
**Given** application updates may change data schemas  
**When** the application starts after an update  
**Then** existing profile data should be automatically migrated  
**And** migration should preserve all user settings and preferences  
**And** fallback values should be provided for new settings  
**When** migration fails  
**Then** users should be notified and offered recovery options
