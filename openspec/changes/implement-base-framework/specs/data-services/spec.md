# Data Services Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Service Abstraction Interfaces
The system must provide abstract interfaces for external data services to enable loose coupling and testability.

#### Scenario: Calendar Service Interface Definition
**Given** modules need access to calendar data  
**When** the calendar service interface is defined  
**Then** it should provide methods for retrieving events by date range  
**And** it should support creating, updating, and deleting events  
**And** it should handle both personal and work calendar sources  
**And** it should provide async methods that return standardized data models  
**When** modules consume the calendar service  
**Then** they should only depend on the interface, not implementation

#### Scenario: Task Service Interface Definition  
**Given** modules need to manage tasks and todos  
**When** the task service interface is defined  
**Then** it should provide CRUD operations for tasks  
**And** it should support task categories, due dates, and priorities  
**And** it should handle both personal and work task sources  
**And** it should support recurring task patterns  
**When** multiple modules access task data  
**Then** changes should be synchronized across all consumers

#### Scenario: External Service Interfaces
**Given** integration with Google and Microsoft 365 services is required  
**When** service interfaces are defined  
**Then** weather service should provide current and forecast data  
**And** music service should support playback control and playlist management  
**And** all interfaces should handle authentication and authorization  
**And** services should provide offline capability through local caching

### Requirement: Local Data Caching and Offline Support
The system must provide robust local caching to ensure functionality when external services are unavailable.

#### Scenario: Automatic Data Caching
**Given** external services are accessible  
**When** data is retrieved from external APIs  
**Then** responses should be automatically cached locally  
**And** cache should include timestamps for freshness tracking  
**And** cached data should be stored in SQLite database  
**When** the same data is requested again  
**Then** fresh cache data should be returned if within expiration window

#### Scenario: Offline Mode Operation
**Given** external services are unavailable or network is disconnected  
**When** modules request data  
**Then** the most recent cached data should be returned  
**And** the UI should indicate when data is from cache vs live  
**And** users should be able to continue working with cached data  
**When** connectivity is restored  
**Then** local changes should sync with external services automatically

#### Scenario: Cache Management and Cleanup
**Given** local cache storage has size limitations  
**When** cache grows beyond configured limits  
**Then** oldest unused data should be automatically purged  
**And** user should be able to manually clear cache if needed  
**And** critical user data should be prioritized for retention  
**When** cache becomes corrupted  
**Then** cache should be rebuilt from external services automatically

### Requirement: Data Synchronization and Conflict Resolution
The system must handle data synchronization across multiple sources and resolve conflicts gracefully.

#### Scenario: Cross-Service Data Synchronization
**Given** user has both Google and Microsoft 365 calendars  
**When** calendar data is retrieved  
**Then** events from all sources should be merged and displayed together  
**And** source information should be maintained for each event  
**And** conflicts between overlapping events should be identified  
**When** user creates events in the application  
**Then** events should be created in the appropriate target service

#### Scenario: Sync Conflict Detection and Resolution
**Given** the same data exists in multiple external services  
**When** conflicting updates are detected  
**Then** the conflict should be presented to the user for resolution  
**And** automatic resolution rules should be applied where possible  
**And** user preferences for conflict resolution should be respected  
**When** conflicts are resolved  
**Then** the resolution should be applied to all affected services

#### Scenario: Background Synchronization
**Given** the application is running and has connectivity  
**When** external data changes  
**Then** changes should be detected and synced automatically  
**And** sync should occur in background without blocking UI  
**And** sync status should be visible to users when requested  
**When** sync fails  
**Then** users should be notified and retry mechanisms should engage

### Requirement: Authentication and Security Management  
The system must securely manage authentication with external services while protecting user credentials.

#### Scenario: OAuth Token Management
**Given** services require OAuth authentication  
**When** user authenticates with external service  
**Then** tokens should be securely stored using Windows credential manager  
**And** token refresh should be handled automatically  
**And** expired tokens should trigger re-authentication flow  
**When** user logs out or removes service  
**Then** all stored credentials should be securely removed

#### Scenario: Multi-Service Authentication
**Given** user has multiple external service accounts  
**When** authenticating with services  
**Then** each service should maintain independent authentication  
**And** failure of one service should not affect others  
**And** users should be able to manage connected services independently  
**When** authentication fails  
**Then** service should gracefully degrade to cached data only

#### Scenario: Data Privacy and Encryption
**Given** sensitive user data is cached locally  
**When** data is stored  
**Then** personal information should be encrypted at rest  
**And** encryption keys should be managed securely  
**And** data should be protected from unauthorized access  
**When** application is uninstalled  
**Then** all cached data and credentials should be completely removed
