# Navigation System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Collapsible Side Navigation
The navigation system must provide a collapsible sidebar with persistent state that allows users to access different application modules.

#### Scenario: Navigation Panel Expansion and Collapse
**Given** the navigation sidebar is in collapsed state  
**When** the user taps the expand button or swipes right from the left edge  
**Then** the sidebar should animate to expanded state  
**And** module icons and labels should become visible  
**When** the user taps the collapse button or taps outside the expanded sidebar  
**Then** the sidebar should animate to collapsed state  
**And** only module icons should remain visible

#### Scenario: Navigation State Persistence
**Given** the user has expanded the navigation sidebar  
**When** the application is closed and reopened  
**Then** the navigation sidebar should restore to the previous expanded state  
**Given** the user has selected a specific module  
**When** the application is restarted  
**Then** the previously selected module should remain active

#### Scenario: Touch-Optimized Navigation Interaction
**Given** the navigation sidebar is displayed  
**When** the user performs touch gestures  
**Then** swipe right from left edge should expand the sidebar  
**And** swipe left on expanded sidebar should collapse it  
**And** tap and hold on module icon should show module name tooltip  
**And** double-tap on current module should perform module-specific action

### Requirement: Module Registration and Routing
The navigation system must support dynamic module registration and handle routing between different application areas.

#### Scenario: Module Registration
**Given** the application is initializing  
**When** modules register with the navigation system  
**Then** module icons should appear in the navigation sidebar  
**And** modules should be ordered according to their priority  
**And** disabled modules should be visually distinct but still visible

#### Scenario: Module Selection and Navigation  
**Given** multiple modules are registered  
**When** the user taps a module icon in the navigation  
**Then** the selected module should become active  
**And** the content area should display the module's main view  
**And** the navigation should visually indicate the currently active module  
**And** the header should update to show the module title

#### Scenario: Module Content Loading
**Given** a module is selected for the first time in a session  
**When** the module view loads  
**Then** a loading indicator should be displayed while the module initializes  
**And** the module should load its saved state if available  
**And** error messages should be shown if the module fails to load  
**When** switching between already-loaded modules  
**Then** transitions should be immediate without loading indicators

### Requirement: Navigation Visual Design
The navigation must provide clear visual indicators for module state and user interaction feedback.

#### Scenario: Module State Visualization
**Given** modules are displayed in the navigation sidebar  
**When** the sidebar is rendered  
**Then** the active module should have distinct visual highlighting  
**And** inactive modules should use standard styling  
**And** disabled modules should appear dimmed with reduced opacity  
**And** modules with notifications should show indicator badges

#### Scenario: Animation and Transitions
**Given** user interactions with the navigation  
**When** the sidebar expands or collapses  
**Then** smooth animations should provide visual feedback (200ms duration)  
**When** switching between modules  
**Then** content transitions should be smooth and directional  
**And** loading states should include appropriate progress indicators  
**And** touch feedback should be immediate (haptic feedback if available)

#### Scenario: Accessibility Support
**Given** users with accessibility needs  
**When** navigating with keyboard  
**Then** all modules should be reachable via Tab key navigation  
**And** Enter/Space keys should activate selected modules  
**And** module names should be announced by screen readers  
**When** using high contrast mode  
**Then** navigation visual states should remain clearly distinguishable
