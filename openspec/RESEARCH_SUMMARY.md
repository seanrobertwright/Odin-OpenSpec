## Conclusion

The research required for the remaining tasks is extensive but manageable with proper planning. The highest priority should be given to researching the application shell architecture (Tasks 5-6) and user management systems (Tasks 8-10), as these form the foundation for all subsequent development. 

Total estimated research time: **55-75 hours** across all remaining tasks.

The modular nature of the tasks allows for parallel research and development, with some tasks (like testing and documentation) being conducted alongside implementation of core features.
